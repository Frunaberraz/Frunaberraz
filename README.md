- ### :brazil:

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin, thanks to the @Santander

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in gamification - since, in the future, I want to manage a new way to help students to learn

- :game_die: A random fact about me is that I love learning about the stock market and that I'm able to play violin :violin:
